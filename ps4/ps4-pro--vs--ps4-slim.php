  <div class="ArticleCon4">The decision of PS4 Pro vs. PS4 Slim is still a tricky one to make, even though their successor is now available for purchase. These two varieties both look like elegant high-tech hamburgers, they're actually pretty different. <br><br>

The $299 PS4 Slim (which is now simply known as PS4) replaced the original model with a slightly shrunk-down design. The $399 PS4 Pro is a 4K entertainment machine that can play games and movies in ultra-high resolution.<br><br>

Now that the PS5 is out, these two consoles might seem obsolete. However there's not a lot of next-gen-only games available yet, plus PS5s are very tricky to get a hold of right now.

While the question of PS4 Pro vs. PS4 Slim is somewhat moot since it's not easy to find either right now, they are still an excellent pair of consoles. So if you want a PlayStation console right now, or a good deal on an older model, which one should you buy? <br><br>

  <div class="ArticleCon44">The <mark>PS4</mark> Slim is the refreshed version of the standard PS4, with a design that Sony says is 30 percent smaller, 16 percent lighter and consumes 30 percent less power than the launch model. So unless you really need those few inches of extra space, folks who already own a PS4 have virtually no reason to buy the Slim <br><br>

At $299, however, the Slim is the cheapest barrier of entry for aspiring PS4 owners who want to play Ghost of Tsushima or Death Stranding. Also, the Pro won't do you much good if you don't have a good TV with 4K compatibility, so if you don't already own a 4K TV or don't have the budget to buy one, go with the Slim.<br><br>

If you don't have a PS4 yet, own a 4K television and can afford to spend a little more, you should absolutely go for the PS4 Pro. For $100 more, you get a console capable of playing games and streaming movies in 4K resolution. <br><br>

  <div class="ArticleCon444">So should existing PS4 owners upgrade to the Pro? That's a tougher call. The ever-growing list of PS4 Pro enhanced games includes Red Dead Redemption 2, Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Horizon: Zero Dawn, Uncharted 4 and Destiny 2, so it all depends on what you play and how badly you want to see those games in shiny 4K. Naturally, due to its extra power, the PS4 Pro is notably chunkier than the PS4 Slim, which you may notice if you're trying to fit it under your TV or in a narrow cubbyhole. <br><br>

The PlayStation VR headset works on any PS4, though you'll get the smoothest virtual reality experience possible on the Pro when getting immersed in games like Tetris Effect and Resident Evil 7.<br><br>

Both the PS4 and PS4 Pro support High Dynamic Range for richer, brighter colors on supported TVs. So whether your screen of choice can use HDR or not, it won't make a difference to your buying decision <br><br>

<h1 class="titles">PS4 Pro vs. PS4 Slim: Game Library

One thing you won't have to factor in when choosing your PS4 is game selection. All current and upcoming PS4 games work on PS4, PS4 Slim and PS4 Pro — the only difference is they might look a little prettier on the Pro. That means that you'll get to play excellent exclusives like Spider-Man, God of War and Uncharted 4 as well as third-party blockbusters such as Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare no matter which console you choose.<br><br>


<h1 class="titles">PS4 Pro vs. PS4 Slim: What About the PS5?
</h1>
If you're debating between the PS4 and PS4 Pro, perhaps you're also wondering whether you should get a PS5. The next-gen PlayStation is more powerful, offers new features like its haptics-heavy DualSense controller and 3D audio and comes with some new exclusive games. But it's more expensive, and difficult to buy due to ridiculously high demand. Besides, it probably won't come into its own for another year or two yet, once developers have got to grips with making games for the system. <br><br>
The PS4 Slim is arguably better to buy right now because it's cheaper, leaving you more money for the PS5 when you fancy picking one up. However now Sony has ended production of most PS4 models, you may just accept the wait for the PS5 to come back into stock. <br><br>

<h1 class="titles">PS4 Pro vs. PS4 Slim: Bottom Line
</h1>
All in all, the PS4 Slim is a good budget buy, while the PS4 Pro is a wise choice for gamers with 4K televisions who want the very best experience available. That is, if you want a PlayStation right now. Waiting for the PS5 might be a good idea if you want to make more of an investment, albeit a more expensive one, in long-term gaming enjoyment. <br><br>

You also shouldn't forget about Microsoft's offerings either, even if you consider it blasphemy to buy a non-Sony console. There's the $249 Xbox One S, which has a 4K Blu-ray player and offers HDR gaming, as well as the $499 Xbox One X, which offers even more 4K power than the PS4 Pro, although it does cost more. Then there's the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, the next-gen Xbox consoles. Like the PS5, they are more expensive and harder to find than the older models, but will have a longer life overall.<br><br>
